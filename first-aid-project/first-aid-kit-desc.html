                    <h2>Bandage Wrap / Gauze</h2>
                    <p>Bandage wrap is used to cover a large area. For example, you would use bandage wrap to create a sling for a broken arm, or to cover a large cut. A lot of Medical Ninja refer to bandage wrap as gauze, but don't worry they mean the same thing!</p>

                <article id="bandaid-desc">

                    <h2>Bandaids</h2>
                    <p>Bandaids are a staple in every first aid kit. They are best used for little cuts, blisters or scars, like those from a splinter. They make sure that the injury is protected from more harm! Anyone can use a bandaid, just peel off the back covering and stick it onto the skin, making sure the non-sticky part cover the wound. Make sure to replace bandaids if they get too old and lose their stickiness!</p>

                <article id="gloves-desc">

                    <h2>Gloves</h2>
                    <p>As a Medical Ninja, we must always make sure we keep our hands clean to keep us, and the patient safe. Remember, dirt and germs going into injuries can cause an infection. Gloves are perfect for one-time use! If you don't have gloves with you, make sure you keep some soap and water or hand sanitizer to make sure your hands are clean.</p>

                <article id="tweezers-desc">

                    <h2>Tweezers</h2>
                    <p>Not only are tweezers helpful when plucking out hairs, they can also be used for removing bee stings and splinters! If a window is broken and a small piece of glass gets stuck in your skin, our hands would be too big to grab onto the glass. It also very dangerous, as we can get hurt too! I can always rely on my tweezers save the day.</p>

                <article id="scissors-desc">

                    <h2>Scissors</h2>
                    <p>When keeping bandage wrap in our first aid kit, we need to also bring scissors! This is because we dont want to waste the bandage wrap when the injury is already covered. Scissors can also come in handy when you need to get to an injury, but the persons clothing is in the way.</p>
